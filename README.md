## About the project

This project was created as part of the final stage of the software testing course and is educational. We,  
the Brigade 40 team, conducted a comprehensive testing of the PetSitters platform, developed by students as an educational web application.

PetSitters is a service for searching and booking pet care services. The platform allows users to register, find verified performers, manage orders, leave reviews, and use a rating system.  
The project includes various modules, such as a personal account, authorization system, service booking, and profile management.

The main goal of our work is to test this project from different aspects, using various testing methodologies, modern tools, and working through the entire testing cycle from requirements analysis to reporting.

## Our approach to testing

We used a structured and systematic approach based on best testing practices:

1. **Requirements analysis** – we studied the specifications and analyzed the system using the FURPS (Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability) model.  
2. **Creating test documentation** – developed a test plan, test cases, and checklists to verify key functional and non-functional requirements.  
3. **Functional testing** – tested the main user scenarios: registration, authorization, booking, working with a profile, and payments.  
4. **API testing** – used Postman and Newman to test API endpoints for correctness, security, and error handling.  
5. **UI/UX testing** – checked the usability of the interface, compliance with layouts, and responsiveness of the site on different devices.  
6. **Load testing** – using Artillery, we tested the system under high load to determine its performance.  
7. **Automated testing** – developed tests for Selenium WebDriver + JUnit, implemented CI/CD with Jenkins.  
8. **Reporting** – We used Allure and also documented the bugs we found in Jira.

## Test results

### General statistics
- 200 test cases:
  - 136 positive scenarios (successful checks)
  - 64 negative scenarios (error handling)

### Functional tests
- Registration and authorization – Passed
- Booking services – 2 errors with cancellation processing
- Search for performers – Passed
- Profile management – Passed
- Review system – 1 bug (rating is not updated after deleting a review)

### API testing
- 100 API requests via Postman – 97% successful
- 3% of errors: incorrect processing of invalid data

### Load testing (Artillery)

| Requests   | Average response time | Successes | Bugs |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------|------|
| 100        | 38 ms                 | 100%      | 0%   |
| 1000       | 39 ms                 | 99.5%     | 0.5% |
| 5000       | 41 ms                 | 97%       | 3%   |

### Automated testing
- 50 Selenium tests – 95% successful, 5% unstable due to UI delays

### Bugs registered in Jira
- Total: 37 bugs
- Fixed: 30
- Remaining relevant: 7

### Key issues that require fixing
1. Incorrect handling of booking cancellations.  
2. Error updating rating after deleting a review.  
3. The API does not always correctly handle incorrect data.
